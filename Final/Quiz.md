   - **Correct Answer:** C

#### 5. Collections
**Question:** In Java Collections Framework, which of the following is true about `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?
   - A) `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` both use a dynamic array to store elements.
   - B) `ArrayList` provides faster insertion and removal operations than `LinkedList`.
   - C) `LinkedList` provides faster random access of elements than `ArrayList`.
   - D) `LinkedList` consumes less memory than `ArrayList` for large lists.
   - **Correct Answer:** D

These questions test a range of advanced Java OOP concepts. To create a complete set of 50 questions, continue in a similar vein, ensuring a variety of topics and difficulty levels.
### Additional Advanced Java OOP Questions

#### 6. Inner Classes
**Question:** What is a characteristic of a static inner class in Java?
   - A) It can access non-static members of the outer class.
   - B) It requires an instance of the outer class to be instantiated.
   - C) It can only be declared within a static method.
   - D) It does not require an outer class instance to be instantiated.
   - **Correct Answer:** D

#### 7. Exceptions
**Question:** Consider the following Java code snippet:

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   } catch (Exception e) {
       System.out.println("Exception caught");
   } finally {
       System.out.println("Finally block executed");
   }
   ```

   **What is true about the 'finally' block?**
   - A) It is executed only if an exception is thrown.
   - B) It is not executed if an exception is caught in the 'catch' block.
   - C) It is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught.
   - D) It will not execute if the 'catch' block contains a return statement.
   - **Correct Answer:** C

#### 8. Annotations
**Question:** What is the primary use of the `@Deprecated` annotation in Java?
   - A) To mark a method or class that should not be used anymore.
   - B) To indicate that a method or class is going to be removed in future versions.
   - C) To automatically document methods or classes.
   - D) To prevent a method or class from being serialized.
   - **Correct Answer:** A

#### 9. Reflection
**Question:** In Java, which statement is true about Reflection?
   - A) It allows an application to observe and modify its own behavior at runtime.
   - B) Reflection can only be used to inspect objects, not modify them.
   - C) Using Reflection significantly improves the performance of the application.
   - D) Reflection is primarily
   - 
#### 9. Reflection (continued)
   - A) It allows an application to observe and modify its own behavior at runtime.
   - B) Reflection can only be used to inspect objects, not modify them.
   - C) Using Reflection significantly improves the performance of the application.
   - D) Reflection is primarily used for compile-time type checking.
   - **Correct Answer:** A

#### 10. Encapsulation
**Question:** What encapsulation property is violated if a class has public data fields?
   - A) Data Hiding
   - B) Inheritance
   - C) Polymorphism
   - D) Abstraction
   - **Correct Answer:** A

#### 11. Inheritance
**Question:** What happens when a subclass in Java has a method with the same signature as a method in the superclass?
   - A) The method in the subclass is hidden.
   - B) The method in the superclass is overridden.
   - C) A compilation error occurs.
   - D) The method in the superclass is overloaded.
   - **Correct Answer:** B

#### 12. Abstract Classes
**Question:** Which statement is true about abstract classes in Java?
   - A) An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
   - B) If a class has at least one abstract method, it must be declared abstract.
   - C) An abstract class cannot have a constructor.
   - D) Both A and B.
   - **Correct Answer:** D

#### 13. Generic Types
**Question:** What is the purpose of wildcards (`?`) in Java generics?
   - A) To specify an unknown type.
   - B) To enforce type safety.
   - C) To allow the creation of generic instances.
   - D) To restrict a type to a specific class hierarchy.
   - **Correct Answer:** A

#### 14. Collections Framework
**Question:** In the Java Collections Framework, which is a true statement about the `HashSet` and `TreeSet` classes?
   - A) `HashSet` maintains elements in sorted order, while `TreeSet` does not.
   - B) `TreeSet` allows duplicate elements, but `HashSet` does not.
   - C) `HashSet` offers constant time performance for basic operations, while `TreeSet` does not.
   - D) Both `HashSet` and `TreeSet` are synchronized.
   - **Correct Answer:** C
